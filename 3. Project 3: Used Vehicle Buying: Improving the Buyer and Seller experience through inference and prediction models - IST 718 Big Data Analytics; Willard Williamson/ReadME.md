# Project 3 – IST 718 Big Data Analytics; Willard Williamson

Project Title: “Used Vehicle Buying: Improving the Buyer and Seller experience through inference and prediction models”

Task: Research a topic of choice and conduct analysis using techniques covered in class culminating in a written report and presentation

Purpose: As a member of a team, employ the machine learning concepts covered in the course 

Method: Data Analysis using Python and Spark distributed processing

Insights: Our analysis provides evidence that:<br/>
•	With respect to predict price, a vehicle’s horsepower, milage, and engine displacement are the leading vehicle attributes that predict price<br/>
•	Predicting price is best achieved through our Random Forest model which rendered our lowest MSE with features that explain over 90% of the variation in price <br/>
•	With respect to predicting if a vehicle will remain listed on the market for more than 60 days, having a franchise dealer involved, whether the vehicle is listed as a cab or not, the vehicle's type of body, and price are the leading attributes that predict if a vehicle will remain listed that amount of time on the market<br/>  
•	With respect to predicting if a vehicle was ever part of a commercial fleet, the vehicle’s model year, the vehicle’s mileage, and the vehicle’s owner count are the leading attributes that predict if it was part of a fleet
