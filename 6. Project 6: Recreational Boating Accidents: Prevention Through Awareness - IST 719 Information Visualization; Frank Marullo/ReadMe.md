# Project 6 – IST 719 Information Visualization; Frank Marullo

Project Title: “Recreational Boating Accidents: Prevention Through Awareness”

Task: Create a high quality visualization poster that summarizes a semester long project that requires: 1) Picking and preparing a dataset with R; 2) Defining an audience and requirements for the visualizations; 3) Experimenting with different visual encoding and graphic design choices, 4) Executing the visualization, and 5) Presenting the final product.

Purpose: Exercise skills learned in the course with an emphasis on R programming and Adobe Illustrator

Method: Presentation and Poster using R programming and Adobe Illustrator

Insights: Our analysis provides evidence that:<br/>
•	Generally, boating accidents, regardless of outcome, most often result in a collision and are primarily caused by operator inattention or improper lookout<br/>
•	For accidents involving injury, most often an individual experiences a cut or broken bone<br/>  
•	For accidents involving death, the leading cause of the accident is alcohol, which most often results in death from drowning<br/>   
•	In summary, the best way to boat safely is to pay attention, assign a lookout, wear a life vest, and to drink alcohol responsibly<br/>
