# Project 2 – IST 652 Scripting for Data Analysis; Ying Lin, Ph. D

Project Title: “Recreational Boating Accidents: Causes, Insights, and Ways to Improve Boater Safety”

Task: Conduct an individual project programed using Python

Purpose: Apply the data analytics and machine learning knowledge learned from the course to solve a real-world problem set.

Method: Data Analysis using Python

Insights: My analysis provides evidence that:<br/>
•	Nearly half of all boating accidents reported to the Coast Guard result in serious injury; 12% result in death<br/>
•	Rough seas, poor viability and human error are leading causes of catastrophic outcomes<br/>
•	Operators can improve outcomes if they pay attention, properly assign lookouts to help keep watch for other boats and obstacles, or elect to stay at the dock when weather and visibility are degraded.
