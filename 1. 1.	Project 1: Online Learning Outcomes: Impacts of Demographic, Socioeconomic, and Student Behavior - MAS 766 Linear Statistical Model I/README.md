Task: Research a topic of choice and conducting analysis using techniques covered in class culminating in a written report and presentation to top management or researcher
Purpose: As a member of a team, employ the linear statistical modeling techniques studied in the course

Insights: Our analysis provides evidence that:
•	A student’s demographics, their socioeconomic status and their academic behavior play a role in determining online academic outcomes  
•	Students from a wealthier regions have advantages, and how access to broadband matters
