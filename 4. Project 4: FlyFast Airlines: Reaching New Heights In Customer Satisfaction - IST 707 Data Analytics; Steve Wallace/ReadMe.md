# Project 4 – IST 707 Data Analytics; Steve Wallace

Project Title: “FlyFast Airlines: Reaching New Heights In Customer Satisfaction”

Task: Identify a real-world problem and develop an analysis report and briefing complete with recommended actions based on findings 

Purpose: As a member of a team, apply analytics and machine learning concepts covered in the course 

Method: Data Analysis using Orange, R, and Weka

Insights: Our analysis provides evidence that:<br/>
•	Generally, the air travel market is split evenly across NPS status with Promoter taking the majority stake at 35.73%, Passives at 34.24%, and Detractors at 30.03%<br/> 
•	Adult and Senior Female travelers are a high-payoff market segment and with their needs were met, they could radically improve FastFly’s Promoter numbers<br/>
•	Prioritize marketing and testing resources on moving Detractors to Promoters before trying to move Passives to Promoters<br/>
•	Offer free Airline Status upgrades to Seniors even if this means increasing costs slightly as Senior are only moderately price sensitive. Adding a “Senior Aline Status” membership where senior travelers receive unique benefits (e-readers, books, early boarding, closer seating to the front, reserved overhead storage in front of planes, free drinks, etc.) would help improve FastFly’s reputation amongst Senior travelers and better align their NPS status proportions to levels amongst our competitors
